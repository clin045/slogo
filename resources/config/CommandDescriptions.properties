YCoordinate = YCOR: returns the turtle's Y coordinate from the center of the screen
Heading = HEADING: returns the turtle's heading in degrees
IsPenDown = PENDOWN?: returns 1 if turtle's pen is down, 0 if it is up
IsShowing = SHOWING?: returns 1 if turtle is showing, 0 if it is hiding
Stamp = STAMP: draw the image of the turtle in its current settings on the workspace display so that it remains there after the turtle itself moves away from that location and returns index of the turtle's image used for the stamp
ClearStamps = remove all stamps that have been made returns 1 if there were any stamps cleared, 0 otherwise

#Math
Sum = SUM: returns the sum of its parameters

Power= POW: returns base raised to the power of the exponent
Pi=PI: returns pi
#Control Structures
MakeVariable = Creates a new variable or overrides value of the last one
SetVariable=Sets a value of an already existing variable
Repeat= Runs command(s) given in the list the value of expr number of times
DoTimes= Runs command(s) for each value specified in the range, i.e., from (1 - limit) inclusive
For= runs command(s) for each value specified in the range, i.e., from (start - end), going by incrementr
MakeUserInstruction= Assigns command(s) given in the second list to commandName using parameters given in first list as variables
If= if expr is not 0, runs the command(s) given in the list\nreturns the value of the final command executed (or 0 if no commands are executed)
Ifelse= if expr is not 0, runs the trueCommands given in the first list, otherwise runs the falseCommands given in the second list\nreturns the value of the final command executed (or 0 if no commands are executed)

#Booleans
LessThan =  returns 1 if the value of expr1 is strictly less than the value of expr2, otherwise 0
GreaterThan = returns 1 if the value of expr1 is strictly greater than the value of expr2, otherwise 0
Equal = returns 1 if the value of expr1 and the value of expr2 are equal, otherwise 0

NotEqual = returns 1 if the value of expr1 and the value of expr2 are not equal, otherwise 0
And = returns 1 if test1 and test2 are non-zero, otherwise 0
Or = returns 1 if test1 or test2 are non-zero, otherwise 0
Not = returns 1 if test is 0 and 0 if test is non-zero


Tell = sets turtles that will follow commands hereafter
Ask = only the turtles given in first list all run commands given in the second list \nreturns result of last command run by the last turtle
Turtles = returns number of turtles created so far
ID = returns current active turtle's ID number
AskWith = tell turtles matching given condition to run commands given in the second list


#Turtle Commands
ClearScreen= Clears Screen
Forward = FORWARD: Moves Turtle forward by a set amount of pixels
Backward = BACK: Moves Turtle backward by a set amount of pixels
Left = LEFT: Turns the turtle left by some number of degrees
Right = RIGHT: Turns the turtle right by some number of degrees
SetHeading = SETHEADING: Sets the turtle's heading
SetTowards = TOWARDS: Sets heading towards a point
SetPosition = SETXY: moves turtle to an absolute screen position, where (0, 0) is the center of the screen\nreturns the distance turtle moved
PenDown = PENDOWN: puts pen down such that when the turtle moves, it leaves a trail
PenUp = PENUP: puts pen up such that when the turtle moves, it does not leave a trail
ShowTurtle = SHOWTURTLE: makes turtle visible
HideTurtle = HIDETURTLE: makes turtle invisible
Home= moves turtle to the center of the screen (0 0)
SETPENCOLOR = sets color of the pen to that represented by index
SETBG= sets background color of screen to that represented by index
THICCCCCC= sets size of the pen to be pixels thickness
SetShape = sets shape of turtle to that represented by index
setPalette = sets color corresponding at given index to given r g b color values
GetPenColor = returns turtle's current color index
GETSHAPE=returns turtle's current shape index
