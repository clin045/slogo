### Timeline

Start Date: 10/15/2018

Finish Date: 10/29/2018

Hours Spent: 200

### Primary Roles
* Michael Glushakov: Text parsing and command call logic
* Christopher: Command logic
* Max: Turtle and VariableTracker
* Xi: Front End
### Resources Used
* spike_slogo
### Running the Program
The main class is FrontEnd.Main. 



Assumptions or Simplifications: 
* When calling clearscreen, all turtles except one are removed. We made this choice because turtles will be overlapping and it becomes more difficult for users to click on the overlapping turtles if all of them are set to the origin

* The info displayed in the turtle status panel reflects the state of the turtle that is clicked by users most recently


Notes:

When creating or setting a variable, do not prefix it with a colon. 
```java 
make x 10
not
make :x 10

```
```
sum difference product quotient power and or greader less not equal tell ask
```
can all take any number of parameters in () or just 2 parameters with or without () 

To make the changes in all text input fields to be effective, you have to press enter key after you finish the change


Known Bugs:
* Some user defined commands will give syntax error when being clicked in the defined commands panel
* user can store and read commands without :
* The field where the turtle is rendered changes dimensions when menus are opened/closed
* Recursion does not work
