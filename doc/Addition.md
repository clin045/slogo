- Estimation: The addition will take 30 min to an hour

- Final:
    - Failed to implement due to bugs in frontend, and frontend person being unreachable
    - Implemented the backend part, that works as expected
    - The turtle doesn't actually get removed because of the way the frontend adds turtle views
    - Asked other backend people whether they experienced this issue and they all said they had the same issue due to front-end bugs
    - Frontend code is definitely lacking documentation and obvjously has bugs
