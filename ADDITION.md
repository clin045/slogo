### Estimation

* I think it will take me about half an hour to complete the additional feature.

* I think I just need to change one file because I have a class that is responsible
for creating the frontend menu for all the setting called ControlPanelView.java


### Review

* It took me about half an hour to finish.

* I just need to update one file called ControlPanelView.java because everything
related to UI for changing setting is implemented there.

* Yes, I got it completely right on first try.

### Analysis

* Yes, it was as good as I remembered.

* I could improve my variable naming and hide more boilerplate code.

* If I am not familiar with the code, I will not be able to locate the file that needs
to be change quickly.
